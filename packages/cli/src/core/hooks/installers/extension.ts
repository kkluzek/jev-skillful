/**
 * Shared installer for the two extension-based runtimes.
 *
 * Pi and OMP both discover extensions from a directory under their agent home, so installing
 * for either is the same operation against a different root: write `index.ts` into
 * `<agentHome>/extensions/skillful/`, and remove that one directory to uninstall.
 *
 * Nothing outside our own directory is touched. There is no shared registry file to merge,
 * which makes this the least dangerous of the two installation mechanisms.
