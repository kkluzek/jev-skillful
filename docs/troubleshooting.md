# Troubleshooting

Start with:

```bash
npx @mrgoonie/skillful doctor
```

It reports whether the hook is enabled, whether a key is present, which runtimes have a hook, how
many capabilities were found, how many cache entries exist, and it runs one real route so you can
see the latency and the decision. Most problems resolve there.

## The hook injects nothing, ever

Work down this list.

1. **Is the key set?** `doctor` reports `[FAIL] api key` when `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is missing or
   empty. Skillful reads it only from the environment, so exporting it in a different shell than
   the one your agent runs in has no effect.

2. **Is the hook installed?** `doctor` prints one line per runtime. `present, no hook` means run
   `npx @mrgoonie/skillful install`.

3. **Is it disabled?** `SKILLFUL_DISABLE=1` short-circuits the hook before any work. `doctor`
   reports it as a warning rather than a failure, because it is a legitimate setting.

4. **Did the session restart?** Claude Code and Codex read their hook configuration at session
   start. A hook installed mid-session does not take effect until you start a new one. Pi and OMP
   extensions can be reloaded with `/reload`.

5. **Does the prompt actually need a capability?** Most prompts do not. `doctor`'s trial route
   answers whether the pipeline itself works, which separates "the hook is broken" from "this
   prompt correctly matched nothing".

## The hook injects the reminder line every time

```text
[skillful] Could not resolve a capability suggestion...
```

That line means routing did not complete. The reason is one of `timeout`, `auth`, `upstream`,
`network`, `malformed` or `config`, and `doctor`'s live route check prints which. The hook itself
stays silent about the cause on purpose: it must not fill your agent's terminal with errors.

- `auth` — the key is wrong or expired.
- `network` — `doctor` can reach nothing. Check connectivity, and check that `SKILLFUL_BASE_URL`
  is not pointing somewhere unreachable. A configured base URL is honoured now; earlier versions
  resolved it and then silently discarded it, so if you set one and saw no effect, that was a bug
  rather than a misconfiguration.
- `timeout` — the budget ran out. Raise `SKILLFUL_BUDGET_MS`, or lower it deliberately and accept
  more degradation.
- `config` — the config file is malformed. `doctor` prints each warning.

A degraded result is never cached, so a transient outage does not freeze the behaviour for the
cache's lifetime. Recovery is immediate once the cause is fixed.

## It suggests the wrong capability

Run the same decision path with the internals visible:

```bash
npx @mrgoonie/skillful route --prompt "your prompt" --explain
```

This prints the shortlist, the BM25 score for each candidate, and the model's ranking. The two
answers are different and both matter:

- **The right capability is not in the shortlist.** This is a retrieval miss: BM25 did not match
  your prompt's words to the capability's description. Nothing downstream can recover from it.
  Adding a `when_to_use` field to the skill's frontmatter is the single highest-leverage fix,
  because that field is read for retrieval and is where routing intent belongs.
- **The right capability is in the shortlist and the model picked another.** This is a decision
  error. `show the full ranking` in the explain output tells you how close it was.

Then open an issue with `skillful export-case`, which produces a redacted block with everything
needed to reproduce it.

## Codex never fires the hook

Codex keeps a trust ledger at `~/.codex/config.toml` under `[hooks.state]`, mapping hook script
paths to a `trusted_hash`. Skillful installs into `~/.codex/hooks.json` and deliberately does not
write to that ledger, because authorising its own code inside another tool's security model is not
a decision an installer should make for you. Run Codex once and approve the hook when it asks.

## A settings file looks different

Every modification is preceded by a backup:

```bash
ls ~/.claude/settings.json.bak.skillful.*
```

Comparing the current file with the newest backup shows exactly what changed. Skillful only ever
touches entries carrying its own marker, so a diff that shows anything else is a bug worth
reporting.

If a configuration file was malformed, install reported it and wrote nothing. That is intentional:
refusing to act is recoverable, and clobbering a salvageable settings file is not.

## Uninstall left something behind

`skillful uninstall` removes its hook entries and its extension directory. What it leaves is the
backup files, on purpose, so you can restore an earlier state.

If a settings file that held nothing but the Skillful hook remains as an empty object, that is a
bug: it should have been removed. Earlier versions left an emptied `hooks.UserPromptSubmit: []`
behind, which was visible in a diff and survived into the next install.

## The cache

```bash
rm -rf ~/.cache/skillful
```

Deleting it removes both route decisions and the capability inventory. Route decisions repopulate
on prompts; exact MCP and CLI capabilities repopulate only on the next session-start refresh or an
explicit `skillful refresh`. The cache never holds your prompt text or an API key.

The Claude reminder index is also below this cache root. Its session state and decision log are in
`${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/skillful/`. Unlike route cache entries, the reminder decision
log intentionally contains the bounded query used for diagnosis. Treat it as sensitive. Removing
these files is safe; the index and session state are rebuilt.

## The reminder layer did not run

This is an explicit fail-open status, not a claim that nothing was relevant. Common causes are a
missing/rejected `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, `SKILLFUL_UPLOAD_PROMPT=false`, an empty `MEMORY.md` index, or
the 1800ms reminder budget expiring. Claude continues without a reminder. The decision log above
records the category without ever recording the key.

Reminder selection runs only on Claude resume and compaction, not every prompt. After compaction,
verify that both Skillful entries remain in `hooks.PostCompact` and `hooks.SessionStart`; reinstall
is idempotent and preserves unrelated hooks.

If a route seems stale after you installed or removed capabilities, it should not be: the catalog
fingerprint is part of the cache key, so any change to the catalog invalidates every entry
immediately. A stale decision that survives a catalog change is a bug.

## The catalog is empty or too small

```bash
npx @mrgoonie/skillful catalog --summary
```

A zero count usually means the scanner looked somewhere your capabilities are not. It reads
`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.pi/agent` and `~/.omp/agent`, and honours `CODEX_HOME`, `PI_HOME`,
`OMP_HOME` and `AGENTKIT_OMP_HOME`.

Only `global` and `project` scopes in the current working directory are scanned. A capability in an
unrelated directory is not in the catalog, which is why running from the project you are working in
matters.

## A newly installed or removed tool is not visible yet

The `SessionStart` refresh is asynchronous. It first publishes a fail-closed marker, then checkpoints
affected old partitions as stale before live discovery and publishes successful partitions
independently. A queued or interrupted process therefore cannot leave removed tools routable as
fresh. Failed or stale partitions are not routed. Wait for the background
refresh to finish, or run the client-specific refresh explicitly:

```bash
skillful refresh --runtime codex --json
skillful refresh --runtime claude-code --json
```

An explicit refresh exits `2` if any provider or server inventory is incomplete. The JSON report
identifies the failed partition; successful partitions are still saved.

Do not compare the two inventories as if they were shared. Each client has its own MCP and plugin
configuration, and Skillful partitions the cache by runtime, server and project.

## `npx` is slow

Each hook invocation is a Node process. On a cold start that is most of the budget. The installer
points the hook at an absolute `node` path and an absolute CLI path rather than going through
`npx`, so the hook does not pay `npx`'s resolution cost. If you installed an older version that
used `npx`, reinstalling rewrites the command.

Measured on this machine: a cold route through the hook took 1446ms against the 2000ms budget, and
a cache hit took 221ms.

## Reporting a problem

- **Bad routing** — `skillful export-case --prompt "..."`, then the `bad-route` issue template.
- **Install or hook** — `skillful doctor`, then the `install-problem` issue template.
- **A vulnerability** — [privately](https://github.com/kkluzek/jev-skillful/security/advisories/new),
  never in a public issue.
