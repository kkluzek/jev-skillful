 * Turning a `RouteResult` into the text a hook injects.

 * paid for on every turn, and injecting the whole shortlist would reproduce exactly the
 * "enumerate every available skill" pattern that made retrieval necessary in the first place.
 *
 * The cap is therefore one primary plus at most two runner-ups, and the whole message is
 * bounded by a character budget. Nothing in this module throws: an unroutable result renders
 * to `null`, which the caller treats as "inject nothing".
