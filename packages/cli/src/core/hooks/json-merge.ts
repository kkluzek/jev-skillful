/**
 * Reading and writing the runtime configuration files we share with other tools.
 *
 * This is the most dangerous module in the project. `~/.claude/settings.json` and
 * `~/.codex/hooks.json` belong to the user, and other tools — AgentKit among them — also
 * write hooks into them. Every rule here exists to protect data we did not create:
 *
 * - A file we cannot parse is never overwritten. Refusing to act is recoverable; clobbering
 *   a malformed-but-salvageable settings file is not.
 * - Every write is preceded by a timestamped backup, and the write itself is a temp file
 *   plus a rename, so an interrupted hook cannot leave a truncated configuration behind.
 * - Only entries carrying our marker are touched. Everything else keeps its exact position.
