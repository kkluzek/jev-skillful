/**
 * The route cache, so a repeated prompt does not pay for a repeated round trip.
 *
 * Two rules shape this module and both come from failure modes rather than performance:
 *
 * - **A degraded result is never cached.** If the API is having a bad minute, caching the
 *   failure would freeze the degraded behaviour for the whole TTL, turning a transient
 *   outage into fifteen minutes of the hook doing nothing. A miss costs one request; a
 *   cached failure costs every prompt until it expires.
 * - **A cache that cannot be read or written is treated as empty.** The cache is an
 *   optimisation, so it must never be able to break a route. Corrupt file, permission
 *   problem, concurrent writer: all of it degrades to a miss.
 *
 * Writes are atomic for the same reason the config writes are: several agent sessions on one
 * machine can run hooks at the same instant.
