/**
 * The telemetry event schema.
 *
 * Two rules govern everything here, and both come from the analysis phase 7 has to perform rather
 * than from a preference for tidy data.
 *
 * **The log must be sufficient to reconstruct a paired analysis.** The measured question is
 * whether injection actually helps, compared on the *same* task with and without it. That cannot be
 * reconstructed from a decision count: it needs the prompt identity, the catalog identity, the
 * shortlist, the decision, and the reason. Anything less and the log records that something
 * happened without recording enough to say what it did.
 *
 * **`capability-used` has to be a separate event.** If the log only records routing, a poor
 * outcome cannot be attributed: it is either "the router chose wrong" or "the agent ignored a fine
 * suggestion", and those need completely different fixes. The second event is what separates them.
 *
 * Nothing here carries prompt text, an API key, or an environment value. The prompt is represented
 * by a hash and a length, which is enough to correlate and not enough to read.
