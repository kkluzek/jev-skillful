/**
 * Install the hook into `~/.codex/hooks.json`.
 *
 * **This target was measured, not assumed.** Both supported configuration surfaces were
 * inspected, and the JSON surface was probed by running the agent:
 *
 * - `~/.codex/hooks.json` holds real hook definitions: `hooks.UserPromptSubmit` is an array of
 *   `{matcher, hooks: [{type, command, commandWindows}]}`, exactly the Claude Code shape.
 * - On the measured machine, `~/.codex/config.toml` has a `[hooks]` table whose only child is
 *   `[hooks.state]`, a ledger of `path -> trusted_hash`. Codex supports inline hook tables in this
 *   file too, but that existing state table contains no hook definitions.
 *
 * A probe confirmed which one is live: a temporary entry appended to `hooks.json` produced
 * `hook: UserPromptSubmit` lines in Codex's own output, so the file is read and its hooks run.
 *
 * The probe also surfaced the caveat this installer has to report rather than hide. The probe
 * command did not itself execute, while the pre-existing hooks — all of which are `.cjs` files
 * under `~/.codex/hooks/` with a `trusted_hash` recorded in `config.toml` — did. Codex appears
 * to gate hook execution on that trust ledger, so a freshly installed hook may need the user to
 * approve it once before it takes effect. This installer does not fabricate a `trusted_hash`
 * for itself: writing into another tool's security ledger to silently authorise our own code is
 * not a decision an installer should make on the user's behalf.
